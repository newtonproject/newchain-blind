## NewChainBlind

NewChainBlind is an implementation of an anonymous transaction based on NewChain.

The project aims to hide the sender of the transaction, mainly through blind signature technology.

### Application Case

Alice wants to transfer Bob to 1NEW, but she doesn't want others to know that she has transferred Bob.

Alice can hide her address by following the steps below:

```mermaid
graph TD
K[Bank]
A[Alice]
B[Bob]
A-->|1. Deposit|K
A-->|2. Blind|A
K-->|3. Sign|A
A-->|4. Pay|B
B-->|5. Verify|K
K-->|6. Send Token|B
```


1. Alice deposits 100NEW to Bank
    * Transfer to the address of Bank by NewPay or NewCommander
2. Alice performs blind signature
    * Alice builds a message with a denomination of 1NEW and adds a random string to the message body.
    ```
    m1 = (header info, denomination, serial number), â€¦, mk = (header info, denomination, serial number).
    ```
    * Alice blinds the message m through the PublicKey of the 1NEW denomination of Bank, 
and obtains the blinded message blinded and unblind factor unblinder.
3. Bank sign
    * Alice sends the denomination and the blinded message to the bank
    * Bank checks if Alice has enough denominations for her own
        * Returns an error if it does not exist;
        * If there is one, subtract the NEW of the corresponding denomination;
    * Bank encrypts blinded with PrivateKey corresponding to its 1NEW denomination, and gets sig
    * Bank tells Alice about sig
4. Alice unblind
    * Alice unblindSig by unblind factor unblinder and sig
5. Alice transfers 1NEW to Bob
    * Alice tells Bob about the message body m corresponding to unblindSig and 1NEW
6. Bob verifies to the bank
    * Bob tells the bank to get the message body m and unblindSig from Alice, and tells the bank to transfer the corresponding denomination NEW.
    * The bank verifies the message body m and unblindSig by the NEW PublicKey of the corresponding denomination
7. After the verification is successful, Bank transfers Bob to 1NEW.


### Related instructions

* The anonymity of the hidden transaction sent by the program will be affected by factors such as the number of deposits and withdrawals of the bank and the number of types of transaction denominations.
    1. Number of traders
        * The more bank deposits, the stronger the anonymity
    2. Denomination type
        * The less the bank's denomination, the stronger the anonymity

```

#### Use config.toml

You can use a configuration file to simplify the command line parameters.

One available configuration file `config.toml` is as follows:


```conf
rpcurl = "https://rpc1.newchain.newtonproject.org"
usedhash = ["0xe5ed16d511bb6f511c04fdc19be38b47d3494844e94db04f36fe2c7d4348b75b"]
usedunblinderhash = ["0xb18f64a9cc9ce8082675b65c174041d5fe2fb7b4b2d50084961c280ebe896d29"]
walletpath = "./wallet/"

[balances]
  0x2a8996ebb0314717dfdcd879685a9246649d7bc1 = 1
  0x511eef866c847c78b3ff67b581064007166575b1 = 22
  0x97549e368acafdcae786bb93d98379f1d1561a29 = 53

[bank]
  address = "0x873054eAcB22516E1dBC966C9aE338eef40FE15c"
  cash = "1"
  rsapemprivatekeyfile = "./key.pem"
  rsapempublickeyfile = "./pubkey.pem"
```

* Bank.Cash: Bank-supported denomination type (unit: NEW), only 1NEW support
* Bank.RSAPEMPrivateKeyFile: path to the RSA PEM private key file
* Bank.RSAPEMPublicKeyFile: path to the RSA PEM Public key file

The following fields exist as database storage:
* UsedHash: the list of used hash when deposit to the bank
* UsedUnlinderHash: the sha256sum of used Unlinder when verify it

## Example

Suppose `Alice` wants send 1NEW to `Bob` by the `Bank`,

Bank's address: 0x873054eacb22516e1dbc966c9ae338eef40fe15c

Alice's address: 0x97549E368AcaFdCAE786BB93D98379f1D1561a29

Bob's address: 0x2a8996eBb0314717dfdCd879685A9246649D7BC1

1. Bank: Create the RSA PEM file
    
    Generate an RSA keypair with a 2048 bit private key
    
    ```bash
    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
    ```
    
    Extracting the public key from an RSA keypair
    
    ```bash
    openssl rsa -pubout -in key.pem -out pubkey.pem
    ```

2. Bank: Initialize config file

    ```bash
    # Initialize config file
    NewChainBlind init
    ```
    
    Just press Enter to use the default configuration, and it's best to create a new user.
    
    ```bash
    Initialize config file
    Enter file in which to save (./config.toml):
    Enter the wallet storage directory (./wallet/):
    Enter NewChain json rpc or ipc url (https://rpc1.newchain.newtonproject.org):
    Enter path of Private Key RSA Pem file(./key.pem):
    Enter path of Public Key RSA Pem file(./pubkey.pem):
    Create a new bank account or not: [Y/n]
    Your new account is locked with a password. Please give a password. Do not forget this password.
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    0x873054eAcB22516E1dBC966C9aE338eef40FE15c
    Your configuration has been saved in  ./config.toml
    ```

3. Bank: Get the info of the bank
    
    ```bash
    NewChainBlind info
    ```
    
    then show the public key to all users

4. Alice: Deposit
    
    Use `NewCommander pay` to send 10 NEW to the address of bank, the send the sign tx hash to the bank

5. Bank: Check Alice deposit
    
    Use `NewChainBlind deposit <txHash>` to add the balance for Alice
    
    ```bash
    NewChainBlind deposit 0xfea3844616766cea49c21447d6e5a8c4521192b820c567bff81678615966987e
    ```

6. Alice: Blind
    
    Alice blind 1NEW with a random message and the bank public key
    
    ```bash
    # blind 1NEW, only support 1NEW
    NewChainBlind blind pubkey.pem
    ```
    
    the output of the cmd is as follow:
    
    ```txt
    Data:  20190511140547.data
    Blinded:  20190511140547.blinded
    Unblinder:  20190511140547.unblinder
    Send blinded file to bank
    ```
    
    the file is named with time-based random string, 
    such as `20190511140547` in this example,
    Send 20190511140547.blinded to bank

7. Bank: Sign
    
    The Bank sign the blinded file `*.blinded` for Alice.
    The Bank will check the balance of Alice (the array of `balances` in `config.toml`) 
    and sub 1NEW from the balance of the Alice's address
    
    ```bash
    # Sign the blinded file
    NewChainBlind sign 20190511140547.blinded 0x97549E368AcaFdCAE786BB93D98379f1D1561a29
    ```
    
    the output is as follow:
    ```txt
    Sub 1 NEW for 0x97549E368AcaFdCAE786BB93D98379f1D1561a29
    Current balance of 0x97549E368AcaFdCAE786BB93D98379f1D1561a29 is 59 NEW
    Sign:  20190511140547.blinded.sig
    Send signed blinded file back to user1
    ```
    
    then send the 20190511140547.blinded.sig back to the user

8. Alice: Unblind
    
    Alice un-blinds it by using `pubkey.pem`, `*.blinded.sig` and `*.unblinder`
    
    ```bash
    # Unblind with unblinder
    NewChainBlind unblind pubkey.pem 20190511140547.blinded.sig 20190511140547.unblinder
    ```
    
    the output is as follow:
    ````txt
    UnblinderSig:  20190511140547.unblinder.sig
    Send unblinder sig file and cash data to others
    ````

9. Alice Pay to Bob
    * when Alice pay 1NEW to Bob, just send him the file `20190511140547.unblinder.sig` and `20190511140547.data`
    * when Bob get the file, then him should send both of the file `20190511140547.unblinder.sig` and `20190511140547.data` to bank to verify it

10. Bank: Verify

    Verify unblinder and data, then send 1NEW to Bob
    
    ```bash
    # Verify unblinder and data, then send 1NEW to Bob's address
    NewChainBlind verify 20190511140547.unblinder.sig 20190511140547.data 0x2a8996eBb0314717dfdCd879685A9246649D7BC1
    ```
    
    if ok, then the bank pay 1 NEW to Bob's address on chain
